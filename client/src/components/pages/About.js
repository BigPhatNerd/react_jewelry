             <p>Descended from 2500 years of jewelry addicts, the Persian-American designer, 
               Mona Assemi's namesake brand was founded in Washington DC.  
Currently residing in New York City, Mona's work combines sculptural clean lines, sumptuous crystals,
 and elegant metals. She creates a liquid dripping aesthetic frozen in 
    time in the jewelry with an array of formulated acids for her signature ACIDS line. The unusual 14kt plated, 
    silver plated, rose gold plated and gunmetal plated 
    pieces have a chic sheen, yet distressed at the same time for the downtown meets uptown girl. Recent 
    collections have included unusual shapes and sculptural protruding
    elements.</p>
<p>Mona's bold, unexpected pieces can be found gracing the limbs of Kelly Ripa, Giuliana Rancic, Miss Universe 
  Olivia Culpo, Leelee Sobleiski, Patricia Field,
    Betsey Johnson, Princess Noor Pahlavi, Charlotte Ronson, Taylor Momsen, Solange Knowles, Taryn Manning,
     Christa Brittany, Rita Ora,  Giovanna Battaglia and many others.
    The line is amongst some of the best retailers including Harrod's and Henri Bendel.  </p>
<p>The luxury jewelry brand has been featured in Instyle, Hamptons, Marie Claire, WWD, Modern Luxury, Zink, 
  New York magazine, Washingtonian, Capital File, Modern Luxury magazine, What? magazine, Tirade magazine 
  Forbes, Ocean magazine and many others.
 One thing that is seen throughout all her work, is minimalistic lines, the use of repetition and negative 
 space. In addition, Mona likes to always do what's progressive as an emerging designer. You can see her evolve 
 throughout collections aesthetically.  Her biggest and most exciting challenge is to always exceed the lines of 
 what is considered ordinary. She enjoys outside the box accessories. Her work is truly a passion for the art of 
 jewelry. The collections are always fresh, high-end and with edge. In her current collection she has most recently 
 incorporated color with an array of different hues of swarovski crystals. What is said to be her greatest talent 
 is the knack for trend forecasting. 
Editors are always anticipating Mona's next collection as it is bound to be even better than the last.
